            HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is language for creating web pages
            and web applications. Web browsers receive HTML documents from a
            webserver or from local storage and render them into multimedia web
            pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and
            originally included cues for the appearance of the document.

            Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a language used for describing the
            presentation of a document written in HTML. Although most often used
            to set the visual style of web pages and user interfaces written in
            HTML, the language can be applied to any XML document, including
            plain XML, SVG and XUL, and is applicable to rendering in speech, or
            on other media.

            JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, untyped, and interpreted
            programming language. JavaScript is prototype-based with first-class
            functions, making it a multi-paradigm language, supporting
            object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles. It
            has an API for working with text, arrays, dates and regular
            expressions.
